The notebook has been computed on Google Colab, using the L4 GPU. (Colab Pro)

There is a section called 'Load and Test Model' at the end of _flowers_classification_tool.ipynb_ where you can load the trained model and test it on the test data without running the code above.

To run the whole training process, run all the code cells.
